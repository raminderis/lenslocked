1. package: defines the package the code in the file is part of. 
package is a way of grouping similar code together. 

2. main is a special pacakge. when you build and run - go starts with package main. 
the pacakge that needs running, should have a main package. 
some projects have directories with each directory having file with main function.. this doesnt mean more then one main can live in a package. 
it just means each one of those directories can be build independently to be used and run independently of each other. 


3. semantic versioning: major.minor.patch (breakingChange.improvementsOrNewFeatures.BugFixesSecurityUpdates)

4. to check env variables that go tooling is using
go env CGO_ENABLED
go env GOPATH

5. Dynamic Reloading (two tools: modd and air)

6. url gets decoded and used in URL.PATH. before decoding what we have can be read from URL.RAWPATH
this is useful to ensure if there was "/" or "%2F" in the URL to begin with because:
URL.PATH will be: /dog/cat?key=value
URL.RAWPATH will be: /dog%2Fcat%3Fkey=value (also note most of the time rawpath is the same as path and then rawpath will be empty)

7. type HandlerFunc 
allows to use ordernary functions func(ResponseWriter, *Request) as http handlers. 
this is because we have method ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) add to type HandlerFunc in net/http codebase. like this 
`func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)`
and this simply calls the underlying function itself. i.e. f(w,r)
this also means: 
as in `type abc struct{}` // here struct is the underlying type. this makes struct as first class citizens of go. used as a datatype and can add methods to it. 
similarly, `type abc func()` // here func is the underlying type. this makes func as first class citizens of go. used as a datatype and can add methods to it. 

8. http.Handler - interface with the ServeHTTP method 
http.HandlerFunc - a function type that accepts same args as ServeHTTP also implements http.Handler interface. as such func conversion can be used to pass func 
where ever http.Handler is required like in ListenAndServe

then we also have 
http.Handle: this func takes a pattern and http.Handler and used to register to DefaultServeMux
http.HandleFunc : this is a func that takes a pattern and func looks like ServeHTTP for arguments. registers the route to Default ServeMux
