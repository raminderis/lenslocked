THOUGHTS:
Interface: doesnt do any work, but defines what functionality you need. just defines methods doesnt implement them.
Type: actually define the type, what the type needs to have. Type has details and implementation, and it implements the interfaces. As such X is of type interface if it implements all the methods defined in that interface. 
Saying: Return structs, accept Interfaces.

PATH and RawPath
# Path always carries decoded incoming URL 
# if the decoded version of the incoming URL is diff then the incoming URL itself, 
# then RawPath will carry the raw URL as is received. 
# so if the URL is exmaple.com:3000/contact%2Fcat instead of example.com:3000/contact/cat then rawpath will be there. 
# otherwise rawpath stays empty

Cross Site Scripting
> someone is able to run their scripts through your website. 
	idea is dont render directly what you ask for from other people. Because they might give you something like this: "<script>alert("Haha, you have been h4x0r3d!")</script>"
	so you escape and encode it. html/template package does it for you automatically before rendering the page. 
	
Code Injection:
> SQL Injection - can potentially drop tables. 
	eg: Name = "Robert');DROP TABLE Students;"
	This can drop Students table and delete a bunch of data.

Server side rendering vs API client side processing:
1. complexity - adds unnecessary complexity if not needed. 
2. authentication - jwt we need to worry about token management in client side rendering before we hit api.
3. full implementation in backend simply deliver htmls.
4. doesnt need single page feel. if single feel is needed like fb or gmail, then use api based instead of server side rendering. diff version - laptops, desktops, phones, lite version for slow internet connections. 
    for single page, use react, angular, vue, javascript, etc.

 Q: after login how does the browser know when and how to put the auth session info for the server to behave restful?
 
 CHARSET used is the reason what get printed that makes sense, and what gets printed which is gibberish.
